This was followed by a welcome address from Teresita D. Estocapio, a school teacher. Darell Kyle Navalta, the learning resource provider, then introduced the speaker for the day, Jogin Rey Tamayo, a former Editor. The first session of the seminar-workshop was on editorial cartooning. Sir Tamayo taught the students the basics of editorial cartooning and showed them some examples of editorial cartoons. The second session was on editorial writing. Sir Tamayo again led this session, teaching the students how to write editorials. The third and final session was on column writing, where Sir Tamayo taught the students the purpose of and how to write columns. “As a Grade 8 SPJ student, I was truly impressed and enjoyed Sir Tamayo\'s seminar. His talents across various fields left me amazed,” shared Veenuz Lei Bumaltao, an SPJ student. Another student, Andrei Miguel Balmonte, added, “Sir Tamayo gave an in-depth analysis on editorial writing and is helping me improve my journalistic skills.” This campus journalism seminar-workshop was a valuable experience for the students of PCNHS.

Fun and meaningful activities filled the day: pampering and entertainment were fused. Teachers were given free whole-body massages courtesy of the Philippine Association of Licensed Massage Therapists Baguio-Benguet Chapter headed by Emilia Taguiling Latogan. Beadwork jewelry-making workshops provided a creative outlet for the teachers, while carnival-style games like draw lots for teacher freebies and an online &#34;Guess Who&#34; game gave everyone a dose of fun. The most touching experience was probably the &#34;Teacher for a Day&#34; activity wherein students became the teachers in a merry play of roles, indicating their respect for the often-neglected duties of their teachers. A serenade was also conducted for appreciation for teachers, administrators, and staff, each having received heartfelt tokens. To celebrate their special day, teachers deserve to be pampered and take a well-earned break after a long, tiring day of teaching, standing, and instructing. They are truly appreciated by students for their selfless sacrifices and unwavering dedication to supporting their educational journey.')">

                <strong>Refreshing Break</strong><br><br>
                Baguio City, the "Summer Capital of the Philippines" is a popular place because of the many tourism it has like Burnham and SM. However, the recent number of visitors brought many challenges for the city and its citizens. Although the City is benefiting from the increase of tourists by also increasing the demand of hotels, restaurants, souvenir shops, etc, it is also a challenge for the citizens of Baguio.
            </p>
            <p>
                Baguio City is experiencing a significant influx of tourists, particularly during peak seasons and long weekends. This influx has led to a number of issues, like traffic congestion, environmental strain, overcrowding and impact on local culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data on tourist arrivals shows that the city government has seen a significant increase in the number of tourists visiting Baguio City in recent years. Traffic Congestion has become a major problem in the city particularly in peak seasons. Surveys have shown that both citizens and businesses are concerned about the impact of tourism in the City. This led to citizens adjusting and staying home.
            </p>
            <p>
                The influx of tourists in Baguio City has both positive and negative sides, it gives opportunities and challenges. While it provides economic benefits, it also threatens the city's natural beauty and cultural integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
                By working together, the city government, tourism stakeholders, and residents can ensure that Baguio City remains a vibrant and sustainable destination for years to come. If you are a tourist, one of the best ways to lower the environmental impact or tourism is to travel places outside of their busiest season.
